This includes scripts which compute possible CFG parse tree for given sentence using Earley Algorithm and probabilistic Earley Algorithm

command "make run1" will run the Earley.py script and print all the possible sequence for 'the man saw the dog with the telescope' sentence

command "make run2" will run the ProbabilisticEarley.py script and print the most probable sequence for 'the man saw the dog with the telescope' sentence.
